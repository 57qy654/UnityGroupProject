# UnityGroupProject

This project was created by University of Minnesota State Mankato Students William Boguslawski, Jude Pitschka, and Jessica Nguyen. In this project, we created NES Super Mario with a twist. All of the first-level assets, scripts, block placement, etc. were taken and followed from Zigurous's How to Make Super Mario Bros in Unity tutorial on youtube, the link to the first video will be placed at the bottom of this file. After the tutorial, we took the things we learned from the tutorial, MNSU teacher assistants, MNSU tutors, and our data structure class with Professor John Burke to create our own enemies, assets, scripts, and more.

We would like to give a big thanks to Zigurous for providing the initial tutorial, our Professor John Burke for fighting to give us students the opportunity to work on a project, our teaching assistant Isaac Bustad and MAVPASS tutor Madeline Ellingson for providing feedback and help.
